Sadly the animation part of this project didn't turn out as I had hoped â˜¹

## Still, I was able to learn about:
- ball joints, their types, design, manufacturing methods and use-cases; their differences from universal joints
- methods of mounting components directly on a motor's shaft (**taper bushes** where new for me, so I read quite a bit about them)
- different types of Delta Robots

## Delta Robots resources I found:
